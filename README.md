# Django Codespaces Project

This is a basic Django web application developed in GitHub Codespaces. The application provides an index page and a page to view all the Django sessions.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need Python 3.10 or later to run this application. You can have multiple Python versions (2.x and 3.x) installed on the same system without problems.

In Ubuntu, Mint and Debian you can install Python 3 like this:

```
$ sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip
```

For other Linux flavor, macOS and Windows, packages are available at:

https://www.python.org/getit/

### Installing

The first thing to do is to clone the repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/username/django-project.git
$ cd django-project
```

Create a virtual environment to install dependencies in and activate it:

```bash
$ python3 -m venv env
$ source env/bin/activate  # For Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
```

Then install the dependencies:

```bash
(env)$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once `pip` has finished downloading the dependencies:
```bash
(env)$ cd project
(env)$ python manage.py runserver
```

And navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.
